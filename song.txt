Feet don't fail me now take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that at the gates they'll tell me that you're mine

Walking through the city streets is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night can you make it feel like home
If I tell you you're mine? It's like I told you honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why
Keep making me laugh let's go get high
The road is long we carry on try to have fun in the meantime

Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words this is the last time
'Cause you and I we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see that once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child try'na take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find all the answers, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why
Keep making me laugh let's go get high
The road is long we carry on try to have fun in the meantime

Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words this is the last time
'Cause you and I we were born to die
